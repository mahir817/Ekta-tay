# Housing Module Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the complete housing workflow system that has been implemented for the Ekta-tay platform. The system connects house owners (User X) with applicants/tenants (User Y) through a structured workflow.

## Workflow Steps

### üè† Step 1: User X (House Owner) Posts a Housing Listing
- User X fills out post form with title, rent, location, amenities, and uploads images
- Creates entries in both `services` (type = 'housing') and `housing` tables
- Dashboard shows new post with status "Available"

### üì® Step 2: User Y Applies to the Housing Post
- User Y clicks "Apply" from housing listing details page
- Backend creates record in `housing_applications` with status 'pending'
- Dashboard updates:
  - User Y: "Applied Requests" count increases
  - User X: Shows list of applied users under the post

### ‚úÖ Step 3: User X Shortlists User Y
- Owner dashboard shows each applicant with "Add to Shortlist" button
- Updates application status to 'shortlisted'
- Dashboard updates:
  - User X: New "Shortlisted Users" section appears
  - User Y: "Shortlisted" count increases, "Applied Requests" decreases

### ü§ù Step 4: User X Confirms a Tenant
- From "Shortlisted Users" list, User X clicks "Confirm Tenant"
- Backend:
  - Updates application status to 'accepted'
  - Inserts record into `housing_tenants`
  - Updates housing availability to 'occupied'
  - Automatically rejects other pending/shortlisted applicants

### ‚ùå Step 5: Optional Rejection/Withdrawal Flow
- **Rejection by Owner**: Updates status to 'rejected'
- **Withdrawal by Applicant**: Updates status to 'withdrawn'

## Database Schema

### Key Tables
1. **users** - All registered users
2. **services** - Parent table for all listings (service_id, user_id, type = 'housing')
3. **housing** - Extended info about each housing service
4. **housing_applications** - Applications from User Y to User X's post
5. **housing_tenants** - Finalized tenant records after confirmation

### Status Values in housing_applications
- `pending` - User Y applied to User X's post
- `shortlisted` - User X shortlisted User Y
- `accepted` - User X accepted the shortlisted user (Confirmed Tenant)
- `rejected` - User X rejected the applicant
- `withdrawn` - User Y cancelled the application

## Files Structure

### Backend Files
- `backend/housing_management.php` - Main API for housing workflow
- `backend/apply_housing.php` - Application submission (legacy, updated)
- `backend/owner_dashboard.php` - Owner-specific dashboard functions
- `backend/fetch_housing.php` - Fetch available housing listings

### Frontend Files
- `Modules/Housing/housing.php` - Main housing page
- `Modules/Housing/housing.js` - JavaScript functionality (enhanced)
- `Modules/Housing/housing.css` - Base styles
- `Modules/Housing/housing_workflow.css` - Additional workflow styles

### Setup Files
- `sql/housing_module_updates.sql` - Database schema updates
- `setup_housing_module.php` - Complete setup script
- `test_housing_fix.php` - Test and fix script

## API Endpoints

### Housing Management API (`backend/housing_management.php`)
- `?action=apply` - Apply to housing
- `?action=shortlist` - Shortlist an applicant
- `?action=confirm_tenant` - Confirm tenant
- `?action=reject_applicant` - Reject applicant
- `?action=withdraw_application` - Withdraw application
- `?action=get_my_applications` - Get user's applications
- `?action=get_my_housing_applications` - Get applications for owner's housing
- `?action=get_dashboard_stats` - Get dashboard statistics

### Owner Dashboard API (`backend/owner_dashboard.php`)
- `?action=get_my_housing_posts` - Get owner's housing posts
- `?action=get_applications_for_housing` - Get applications for specific housing
- `?action=get_owner_stats` - Get owner statistics

## Dashboard Statistics

### For Applicants (User Y)
- **Applied Requests**: COUNT(*) WHERE applicant_id = ? AND status = 'pending'
- **Shortlisted**: COUNT(*) WHERE applicant_id = ? AND status = 'shortlisted'
- **Confirmed**: COUNT(*) WHERE applicant_id = ? AND status = 'accepted'
- **Rejected/Cancelled**: COUNT(*) WHERE applicant_id = ? AND status IN ('rejected', 'withdrawn')

### For Owners (User X)
- **My Housing Posts**: COUNT(*) FROM housing WHERE owner_id = ?
- **Total Applications**: COUNT(*) FROM housing_applications WHERE owner_id = ?
- **Active Tenants**: COUNT(*) FROM housing_tenants WHERE owner_id = ? AND status = 'active'

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Updates
```bash
# Option 1: Run the setup script
http://localhost/Ekta-tay/setup_housing_module.php

# Option 2: Execute SQL manually
# Import sql/housing_module_updates.sql into your database
```

### Step 2: Test the Implementation
```bash
# Run the test script to verify everything is working
http://localhost/Ekta-tay/test_housing_fix.php
```

### Step 3: Access the Housing Module
```bash
# Navigate to the housing module
http://localhost/Ekta-tay/Modules/Housing/housing.php
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Foreign Key Constraint Error**
   - Run `test_housing_fix.php` to check and fix database structure
   - Ensure all required columns exist with proper relationships

2. **Applications Not Showing**
   - Check if `owner_id` column exists in `housing_applications`
   - Verify data integrity by running the setup script

3. **Status Not Updating**
   - Clear browser cache
   - Check browser console for JavaScript errors
   - Verify API endpoints are accessible
